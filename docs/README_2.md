## Guidelines
1. **API Development:**  
   - All server-side logic, including authentication or data fetching, belongs under `api/`.

2. **Frontend Assets:**  
   - Organize styles, scripts, and images inside the appropriate subfolders in `assets/`.

3. **PHP Classes:**  
   - Use `classes/` for reusable code or libraries.
   - Leverage `ConnectionPool.php` for handling database connections.

4. **Database Handling:**  
   - Ensure any exported database structures or migrations are added under `sql/`.

5. **Documentation:**  
   - Any new documentation, changelogs, or additional instructions must be placed inside `docs/`.
